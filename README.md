# Python Data API Services Developer Challenge: Shared Document Store

Create an API that stores “digital documents” in “folders”. Folders or Documents can have one or many associated “Topics”, with short & long-form descriptors.

## The challenge

* Using Python 3.9, Django, and PostgreSQL
* Design a basic Docs Store System with the tables “Documents”, “Folders”, and “Topics”
* Communicate this design with enough detail another developer could implement it effectively
* Build the Restful API service such that you can operate on the resources
* Deploy to a free cloud hosting site such as heroku and send us a link to access the finished work
* Ensure to populate the service with enough representative sample data to demonstrate basic request functionality
* Example test case: As a front-end developer, I want to access in a single request all the documents in the folder “Customer Feedback” associated with the topic “SpekiLove!”
